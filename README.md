Hamsterpocket (Pocket) is an Open Source self-managed dollar-cost-averaging protocol that lets users create and run their own saving pools (“pockets”) that will automatically execute the chosen strategies over time.

## **What we deliver out-of-the-box** 📦

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Architecture" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T03N86YEZ6Z-F04T783JZAB/out-of-the-box.png?pub_secret=3ca2221066">
</p>

- **Convenient** - Users only need to set up the desired pools and strategies once, then top up (reload) said pools with the required funds for execution anytime.
- **Trustless** - Users are able to manage their own pools. Every pocket can only be paused, resumed, terminated and withdrawn at will by the pockets’ owners.
- **Flexible use cases**:

  • Run a TWAP strategy on-chain

  • Create a simple saving pool for one or multiple assets

  • Set-and-forget vaults for medium or long-term spot purchases
